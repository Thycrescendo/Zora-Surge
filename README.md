# ZoraSurge

**ZoraSurge** is an AI-powered web application designed to enhance the creator and trader experience on **Zora's Coins Protocol**. Leveraging the Zora Coins SDK, it monitors **Base blockchain** transactions in real-time to detect surging coins, delivering instant browser and in-app notifications when coins experience significant market cap or volume increases (greater than 10%).

With newly added **interactive features** like on-chain trading, customizable alerts, and X (Twitter) sharing, ZoraSurge has evolved from a read-only tracker into a fully engaging trading platform.
